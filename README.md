Nathan Wright - Aspiring Full Stack Developer

Greetings! I'm Nathan Wright, an aspiring Full Stack Developer with a strong passion for front-end mobile development. As a Modern Full-Stack web + mobile Development Graduate, I bring a high level of resourcefulness and a strong eagerness to learn new technologies to the table.

I possess a solid skill set that includes expertise in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript, Tailwind, Next.js, Bootstrap, React, React Native, node.js, Vercel, GCP, and Firebase/Firestore. I'm enthusiastic about applying these skills in real-world projects and contributing to the industry.

ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm actively engaged in expanding my portfolio by developing mobile-first applications using React Native and various JavaScript frameworks. This includes taking on freelance projects to gain hands-on experience and build a diverse range of applications.

ðŸŒ± My ongoing journey involves mastering advanced React concepts, exploring other front-end frameworks, and deepening my knowledge in Python for machine learning and AI applications.

ðŸ‘¯ I'm open to collaborating on open-source projects related to both web and mobile development. I believe in the power of teamwork and collective learning.

ðŸ¤” I'm also seeking guidance and mentorship to navigate my entry into the industry and establish valuable connections with experienced professionals.

ðŸš€ Fun fact: Apart from my dedication to coding, I have a deep-rooted passion for comedy. I've taken to the stage and had successful performances at open mic events. Currently, I'm undertaking the exciting challenge of building an all-encompassing comedy platform known as "Humor Hub." Additionally, I've joined a local ML/AI club to further my knowledge in Python machine learning and am in the process of creating my own AI comic bot for the platform.
